# Food Table


I created this app after completing 100 days of SwiftUI, drawing inspiration from MyFitnessPal. If you’re looking to start a diet, this app could be your solution. It helps you track daily calorie consumption and protein intake, and it also functions as a grocery inventory list. I designed it with a fun, gamer-inspired theme, incorporating a crafting table look and pixelated text.

## Description


My app serves two main purposes: tracking your calories and managing your pantry inventory. It’s designed to be simple yet effective, allowing you to add, edit, or search for items. In the food journal, you can log what you eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The inventory feature helps you keep track of what you need to restock or avoid buying the next time you go grocery shopping.

While the app includes some built-in food items, please note that not all of them have calorie information available.

Though the app is straightforward, there are areas for improvement. Currently, all data is stored locally on your phone, which could potentially use up a lot of space. However, the app automatically removes entries older than 7 days to manage storage efficiently. For future updates, implementing a database could reduce the app’s size and enhance its functionality.


## Demo

Here's a GIF showing add a Sydneys Omelette to breakfast, there are plenty of more features but GIFs can't be too long. If you watch The Bear you would know what this omelette is.

## Installation

Currently I have no plans on releasing this app.
