# Food Table


I made this app after following 100 days of SwiftUI and this app is inspired by MyFitnessPal. Basically if you wanted to start dieting this is your solution. Calculating things like your daily calorie consumption, protein intake and not only that but this can serve as a grocery store list (inventory tab). I aimed it for people who wanted to diet but sort of make it gamer esk, I tried to attempt to go for a crafting table theme and pixelated text.

## Description


My app currently does two things, keep track of your calories, keep track of your inventory(pantry). And I wanted to make sure if it was a simple app it was good at it. Allowing you to add / edit items or even search things you may not know of. I think making something easy is the best way to start something. In your food journal you may keep track of what you eat for breakfast lunch and dinner, and for the inventory you may see what you need to restock up on or may not want to restock up on the next time you are out grabbing groceries. There are a couple things that could be improved on this app but I decided to keep it simple due to it being my first app. One, all of this is stored on the phone, so it may take up infinite space?! No everytime you add a day if will remove days that are beyond 7 days old so no worries about space. That also means like the list of items you store is local. These problems can easily be solved a database and allow the app to become smaller in size actually.


## Demo

Here's a GIF showing add a Sydneys Omelette to breakfast, there are plenty of more features but GIFs can't be too long. If you watch The Bear you would know what this omelette is.

## Installation

Currently I have no plans on releasing this app, there's not enough features on this app.
